    <h2>Student Testimonies</h2>
    <div>
      I came into TaiwoStudio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in
      software development. <br />
      However, within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software
      development <br />
      and also master the soft skills required for being a software developer.
      <br />
      So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in
      my career as a software developer. <br />

      TaiwoStudio Academy has been one of the big push I needed to get in the
      real world space. I had an immense learning that was really different from
      the self learning I started with. The learning was fun and there were some
      internship job opportunities that were presented to us. I got my first gig
      immediately after the program. Thank you TaiwoStudio for that push I
      needed. <br />

      I bless the day the Instagram algorithm pop up Tech Studio Academy to my
      news feed. I read through their curriculum and other details about the
      Bootcamp and I told myself this is the opportunity I've been waiting for.
      I wasn't disappointed, the environment was well ventilated and conducive,
      with competent instructors. Here I am today at OT&T Consulting, fulfilling
      my dreams thanks to Tech Studio Academy. <br>
